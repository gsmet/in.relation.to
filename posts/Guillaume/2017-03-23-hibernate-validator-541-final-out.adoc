== A bugfix release

Hibernate Validator 5.4.1.Final is a bugfix release, mostly for corner cases. 5.4.1.Final is a recommended upgrade for everyone.

Here are the most prominent bugfixes of this release:

 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HV-1088[HV-1088] - Fix a concurrency issue in validator initialization that you probably wouldn't encounter in a normal usage - you're supposed to use a shared `ConstraintValidatorFactory` which mitigates the issue
 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HV-1280[HV-1280] - Fix a class loading conflict with Xerces in modular environements (e.g. WildFly)
 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HV-1252[HV-1252] - Fix an issue with the annotation processor and JavaMoney support. Thanks go to https://github.com/ghusta[Guillaume Husta] for this one.
 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HV-1253[HV-1253] - A few TYPE_USE mentions had been mistakenly introduced in 5.4 when backporting from 6 (5.4 still supports Java 6)

We also integrated a new translation, Persian, thanks to https://github.com/shahramgdz[Shahram Goodarzi].

And finally, we upgraded our build instructions for the latest JDK 9 early access build.

As usual, you can find the complete list of all addressed issues in the https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-validator/blob/5.4.1.Final/changelog.txt[change log].
